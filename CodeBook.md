#Introduction
This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

#Variables
Subject - Numerical reference to the person in the experiment.

ActivityName - Title of the activity.

Domain - Name of the domain, Time or Fast Fourier

Sensor - Name of the sensor, Gyroscope or Accelorometer

Motion - Name of the motion, Body or Gravity

Variable - The original reference to the variable used in the raw data.

Value - Numerical value of the result.

#Info about summary choices made
A mean value is used to summarise variable data in terms of domain, sensor and motion data for each subject and per activity.

#Info about experimental study design
Although the data set is in accordance with tidy principles, the original variable is kept for clarity.
